    **Guide**:\
    This challenge requires a malicious application. \
    Make your own malicious/exploit application which you will be installing in the Virtual Android Device.

    **Note**:\
    To get your own Virtual Android Device, click `Get Connection Info` and wait for the container to run (it can take up to 5 minutes). Then you can use VNC using the connection given to connect to the container. To start your Virtual Android Device, follow this steps:
    1. Right click on the remote desktop
    2. Applications > Shells > Dash
    3. Type `~/start_emu.sh`

    Any submissions outside the intented solution will be considered as **INVALID**.
    For example, these types of solution is considered as invalid:
    - Stealing the flag by downloading the challenge .apk from the remote connection
    - Breaking the device using any unintended exploit
    - Reading the flag file directly without the malicious application
